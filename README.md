📄 **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This project is a responsive and interactive web application built to visualize and display user-related data. It includes features like modals, dynamic UI components, and custom visual diagrams.

🛠️ **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- **Next.js** – React framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **React** – UI library
- **Emotion Styled Components** – CSS-in-JS styling
- **MUI (Material UI)** – a component library for building responsive user interfaces.
- **Context API** – state management for modal windows
- **createPortal** – React DOM for rendering modals outside the main DOM hierarchy
- **HTML/CSS** – layout and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

🤖 **AI TOOLS USED**

- **ChatGPT** – for generating boilerplate code, debugging, and explaining React hook rules
- **Figma** – for UI design

🧪 **OPTIMIZATION TOOLS**

- **SVG Sprite Generation:**  
  Icons were combined into a single sprite using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app) — a convenient tool for creating and managing SVG sprites.

- **SVG Optimization:**  
  The generated sprite was optimized with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) — an online tool that reduces SVG file size without quality loss.

- **Image Compression:**  
  Images were compressed using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app), which significantly reduces the size of PNG, JPEG, WebP files while preserving visual quality.
